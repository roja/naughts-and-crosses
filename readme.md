A Simple naughts and crosses game built by CoPilot
=

This repo contains a simple game of naughts and crosses which was essentially entirely built using github copilot while testing out it's capabilities.

It makes use of a canvas for the board, can detect winning and draw states and can offer reasonable next move hints for the player.

The hosted version can be found at <https://arbia.co.uk/naughts-and-crosses/>
